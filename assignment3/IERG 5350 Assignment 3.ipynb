    "In this section, you are required to implement a single agent MLP using purely Numpy package. The differences between MLP and linear function are (1). MLP has a hidden layer which increase its representation capacity (2). MLP can leverage activation function after the output of each layer which introduce not linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a MLP with one hidden layer containing 100 neurons and activation function `f()`. We call the layer that accepts the state as input and output the activation **hidden layer**, and the layer that accepts the activation as input and produces the values **output layer**. The activation of the hidden layer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a(s_t) = f( W_h^T s_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "obvious the activation is a 100-length vector. The output values is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q(s_t) = f(W_o ^ T a(s_t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "wherein $W_h, W_o$ are the parameters of hidden layer and output layer, respectively. In this section we do not add activation function and hence $f(x) = x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we also introduce the gradient clipping mechanism. In on-policy learning, the norm of gradient is prone to vary drastically, since the output of Q function is unbounded and it can be as large as possible, which leads to exploding gradient issue. Gradient clipping is used to bound the norm of gradient while keeps the direction of gradient vector unchanged. Concretely, the formulation of gradient clipping is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g_{clipped} = g_{original} \\cfrac{c}{\\max(c, \\text{norm}(g))}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "wherein $c$ is a hyperparameter which is `config[\"clip_norm\"]` in our implementation. Gradient clipping bounds the gradient norm to $c$ if the norm of original gradient is greater than $c$. You need to implement this mechanism in function `apply_gradient` in the following cell."

    "**DQN has make delayed update target network, which is another difference even compared to the traditional Q learning.** DQN maintains another neural network called target network that has identical structure of the Q network. After a certain amount of steps has been taken, the target network copies the parameters of the Q network to itself. Normally, the update of target network is much less frequent than the update of the Q network. The Q network is updated in each step.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the engineering aspect, the differences between `DQNTrainer` and the previous `MLPTrainer` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DQN uses pytorch model to serve as the approximator. So we need to rewrite the `initialize_parameter` function to build the pytorch model. Also the `train` function is changed since the gradient optimization is conducted by pytorch, therefore we need to write the pytorch pipeline in `train`.\n",
    "2. DQN has replay memory. So we need to initialize it, feed data into it and take the transitions out.\n",
    "3. Thank to the replay memory and pytorch, DQN can be updated in a batch. So you need to carefully compute the Q target via matrix computation.\n",
    "4. We use Adam optimizer to conduct the gradient optimization. You need to get familiar with how to compute the loss and conduct backward propagation.\n"
